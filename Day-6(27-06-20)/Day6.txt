==>Sqlite3:
                -->it is a database like mysql,oracle etc.
                --> but its not preforble for developing lorge applications
                --> without installing any software we can use this db that means it
                    store all data inside our harddisk only.
                --> to access this sqlite3 we have to install sqlite3 driver
==>Django Admin:
            --> admin can able to create new user,update existing user
                    delete existing user.
            --> for admin we  have to create a tables
                 i.e python manage.py migrate
            --> to access these admin we have to create superuser
                account
                -->for that we have to run a command
                i.e python manage.py createsuperuser
==>Models:
            --> in models .py we will create one or more classes
            --> here each and every class will represents a db table
            --> in this class each field maps a db column
            --> to convert class into db table we have to run 2 commands
                    1) python manage.py makemigrations
                            -- this command will generate a interface file,it will
                            prepare that file to convert classs to db table
                    2) python manage.py migrate
                            --- this command will create db tables using generated
                            interface file
